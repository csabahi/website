This album was a collaboration between indie rock Korean band, HYUKOH, and Taiwanese psychedelic soft rock band, Sunset Rollercoaster. I truly loved the collaboration and harmonious mix of these 2 bands styles. The emotions of this album speak words and I would recommend everyone to listen to this. The 8 songs over 40minutes was a musical experience I don't hear often

Key tracks:
- Y
- Young Man
- Glue
