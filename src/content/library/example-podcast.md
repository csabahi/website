Dr. Huberman discusses science and science-based tools for everyday life such as sleep optimization, mood boosting, recovery etc. This podcast is very useful when implemented in the daily lifestyle. My favourite aspect of the podcast is the scientific explanations of this phenomena that happen in our body/brain.

Notable episodes:
- AMA #2: Improve Sleep, Reduce Sugar Cravings, Optimal Protein Intake...
- Controlling Your Dopamine for Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction
- Sceince-Based Tools for Increasing Happiness
